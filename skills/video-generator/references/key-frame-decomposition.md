# Key-Frame Decomposition

Higgsfield generation jobs in this workflow accept `start_image` and `end_image` roles.
They do not accept mid-clip key-frame anchors. A shot with key frames must be decomposed
before video generation.

## Strategy Values

| Strategy | Use when |
|----------|----------|
| `single_clip` | No key frames; start and end only |
| `split_at_keyframe` | Key frame represents a required intermediate state |
| `merge_keyframe_motion` | Key frame is advisory and the model minimum duration would make splitting worse |

## Split Algorithm

For a shot with start, key frames, and end:

1. Sort anchors by time: start at 0, key frames by timestamp, end at shot duration.
2. Create sub-clips between adjacent anchors: start -> key01, key01 -> key02, keyNN ->
   end.
3. Each sub-clip receives one `start_image` and one `end_image`.
4. Validate each sub-clip duration against the selected model.
5. If a sub-clip is below the model minimum, choose one:
   - Extend the sub-clip to the model minimum and reduce the neighbour only if every
     resulting sub-clip remains valid and the total still equals the planned shot
     duration.
   - Merge the key-frame motion into the nearest valid sub-clip and mark
     `generation_strategy: merge_keyframe_motion`.
   - Change model only if the new model is already approved by routing guidance.
   - Re-budget the parent shot duration upstream in `shot-specifier`.

Never create a split plan whose sub-clip durations add up to more than the original shot
budget. Overrunning the shot duration misaligns `generated/assembly_order.md` and
downstream editing.

## Example

`S04_SH004`, 6 s, key at 2 s:

| Sub-clip | Anchors | Natural duration | Seedance minimum |
|----------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| A | start -> key01 | 2 s | 4 s |
| B | key01 -> end | 4 s | 4 s |

Because `seedance_2_0` has a 4 s minimum in this workflow, a true split would require
at least 8 s total. That exceeds the 6 s parent shot budget, so `split_at_keyframe` is
invalid unless `shot-specifier` re-budgets the shot to 8 s or longer. For the original
6 s shot, mark the shot `merge_keyframe_motion` and encode the key-frame state in the
generation prompt, or reroute only if an approved model can honour both sub-clips within
the 6 s budget.

## Worked Merge Example

Use `merge_keyframe_motion` when the key frame is useful timing guidance but splitting
would produce invalid or awkward sub-clips.

Example shot:

```text
Shot: S05_SH003
Duration: 8 s
Start: shots/S05_SH003/start.png
Key 01 at 3 s: shots/S05_SH003/key01.png
End: shots/S05_SH003/end.png
Reason to merge: the key frame is a lighting/action beat, not a required separate anchor.
```

Structured intent:

- start frame: Maeve faces a dark monitoring console;
- key frame at 3 s: red warning light reflects across the wall and her cheek;
- end frame: Maeve turns partly away from the console, hand still on the switch.

Prompt language for a single unsplit clip:

```text
From the start frame, Maeve holds her gaze on the dark monitoring console, hand already
resting on the switch. Over the first third of the clip the console remains dim and her
body stays still. Around the middle of the clip, a red warning pulse rises from the
console and sweeps across the wall and her cheek, matching the advisory key-frame state.
By the final seconds she turns partly away from the console while keeping her hand on the
switch, resolving exactly into the supplied end frame. Preserve the console layout,
switch position, wardrobe, and lighting direction throughout. No narration.
```

Upload only the start and end images for the generation job. Keep the key frame path in
the manifest and notes as the advisory state that has been merged into the prompt.

## Manifest Requirement

The manifest must record sub-clips when the split is valid within the parent shot
budget:

| Shot ID | Sub-clip | Start | End | Duration | Strategy |
|---------|----------|-------|-----|----------|----------|
| S04_SH004 | A | start.png | key01.png | 4s | split_at_keyframe |
| S04_SH004 | B | key01.png | end.png | 4s | split_at_keyframe |

This example is valid only if `S04_SH004` has been re-budgeted to at least 8 s. It is
invalid for the original 6 s shot.

For `merge_keyframe_motion`, record the key frame without using it as an upload anchor:

| Shot ID | Sub-clip | Start | End | Duration | Strategy | Advisory key |
|---------|----------|-------|-----|----------|----------|--------------|
| S05_SH003 | A | start.png | end.png | 8s | merge_keyframe_motion | key01.png |
