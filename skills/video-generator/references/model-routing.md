# Video Generation Model Routing

Use this when turning prompt manifests into Higgsfield MCP generation jobs. This is the
execution-facing companion to `skills/shot-specifier/references/model-routing.md`.

## Source Of Truth Boundary

`skills/shot-specifier/references/model-routing.md` is the single source of truth for:

- shot-type to model routing;
- creative routing rationale;
- model-native prompt flattening order;
- reference-priority intent;
- manifest intent fields emitted by `shot-specifier`.

This file is the single source of truth for:

- validating that a completed manifest can be submitted through the live Higgsfield MCP;
- mapping manifest intent to live schema parameters and exact model IDs;
- runtime default overrides;
- empirical output constraints, file-size checks, and actual-resolution checks.

If the two files appear to disagree, use `shot-specifier` routing for creative intent and
use the live MCP schema for executable parameter validity. Update both files in the same
commit whenever a change crosses that boundary.

## Manifest Fields

Every row must include:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `recommended_model` | Exact Higgsfield model ID |
| `routing_rationale` | One sentence explaining the choice |
| `duration_seconds` | Validated per model |
| `aspect_ratio` | Machine parameter, e.g. `16:9` |
| `target_resolution` | Intended output dimensions, e.g. `1920x1080` |
| `resolution_parameter` | Machine resolution hint, e.g. `1080p`; verify actual pixels after download |
| `generation_strategy` | Shot-specifier strategy: `image_to_video`, `start_end_image`, `multi_shot`, or `motion_control` |
| `audio_generation_preferences` | `generated`, `none`, or `supplied` plus ambient/sfx/dialogue flags |
| `model_overrides` | Explicit key/value overrides for live MCP defaults |
| `count` | Requested take count; default `1`, schema-gated maximum from live MCP |
| `required_refs` | Continuity-critical refs that must reach the generation job |
| `review_gate` | `required` or `optional` |

## Manifest Routing Validation

Do not choose a new model from this file during normal generation. A completed manifest
must already contain `recommended_model`, `routing_rationale`, reference requirements,
duration, audio preferences, and overrides from `shot-specifier`.

Use this file to validate whether that manifest can run:

1. Translate the manifest model alias to the exact live Higgsfield model ID.
2. Validate `generation_strategy` against the shot-specifier strategy identifiers, then
   validate media roles, duration, aspect ratio, resolution parameter, audio controls,
   count, and default overrides against the live schema.
3. Stop if the model cannot carry required anchors or continuity refs.
4. If rerouting is required, return to `shot-specifier/references/model-routing.md`,
   write a new manifest row, and record the production decision. Do not silently select
   a fallback model inside `video-generator`.

## Constraint Table

| Model | Duration | Resolution parameter | Image roles |
|-------|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| `seedance_2_0` | 4-15 s for this workflow | `480p`, `720p`, `1080p` when exposed; current MCP may still emit `1344x768` | `start_image`, `end_image`, `image` when exposed |
| `kling3_0` | 3-15 s for this workflow | `720p`, `1080p`, `4K` when exposed; current MCP may expose no resolution parameter and emit `1344x768` | Current S01 MCP surface exposed `start_image` and `end_image` only; generic `image` and motion-control variants must be verified before use |
| Higgsfield DoP/Cinema route | Use live MCP limit | Use live MCP limit | Usually image-to-video; validate start/end support before routing |
| Veo route | Use live MCP limit | Use live MCP limit | Use only when live MCP route accepts required references |

Firecrawl evidence confirms Higgsfield markets Seedance, Kling, and Veo on the public
video surface, supports first/last image references, presents Seedance 2.0 as a 1080p
route, presents Kling 3.0 as a 4K route, and advertises plan-level parallel video
generation limits. The public pages do not expose a full machine-readable MCP schema for
`cfg_scale`, per-call `count`, or exact output pixels. If the live MCP tool reports
narrower limits, different parameter names, or different model IDs, obey the tool and
update the manifest before submission. Do not submit an invalid duration and wait for
the provider to reject it.

When the selected model is `seedance_2_0`, load `seedance-2-deep-dive` before media
upload or job submission. Use it for Seedance-specific reference prioritization, prompt
shape, duration/aspect defaults, quality/speed choices, and retake triage.

When the selected model is `kling3_0`, load `kling-3-0-deep-dive` before media upload
or job submission. Use it for Kling-specific shot structure, camera language, Elements
and Motion Control planning, native audio/dialogue syntax, product prompting, text/UI
safety, and retake triage.

## Empirical Constraints Registry

These values seed validation, not blind submission. Update the generation log whenever
a live job produces different evidence.

| Model | Source | Observed constraint or behaviour | Execution implication |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `kling3_0` | Firecrawl: Higgsfield AI Video and Kling pages | Public UI exposes `16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, start frame, end frame, 5 s default, and `720p`/`1080p`/`4K` choices | Validate the same fields in the MCP schema; do not assume 4K means exact `3840x2160` pixels |
| `kling3_0` | Firecrawl: Higgsfield Kling page | Public page advertises native audio, up to 6 cuts, and up to 15 seconds | Route structured multi-shot or audio-capable shots here only when manifest explicitly requests those features |
| `kling3_0` | S01 session 1 and 2 observations | Current Higgsfield MCP outputs `1344x768` for 16:9 jobs; no resolution parameter was exposed for Kling; the same 8 s shot produced about 21 MB in session 1 and about 8.8 MB in session 2 | Treat `target_resolution` as aspirational until live evidence changes; log actual pixels; treat file-size variance as a review trigger, not a failure by itself |
| `kling3_0` | S01 session 2 observation | Current MCP route accepted only `start_image` and `end_image`, with no generic `image` role | Continuity for Kling must be baked into storyboard frames and prompt constraints before generation |
| `seedance_2_0` | Firecrawl: Higgsfield AI Video page | Public page presents Seedance 2.0 in 1080p and as a first/last-image reference route | Validate `1080p` in live MCP and verify downloaded pixels |
| `seedance_2_0` | S01 session 1 and 2 observations | Active generation took about 90-180 s plus possible serial queueing; current MCP accepted `resolution=1080p` but still downloaded `1344x768`; one 6 s clip was about 4.3 MB | Plan queue order explicitly; treat `resolution` as an internal-quality hint unless actual pixels prove otherwise; files below half of the lowest same-model baseline require review |

## Default Parameter Overrides

Do not rely on provider defaults for audio, reference adherence, mode, quality, genre, or
resolution.

| Model | Observed/default behaviour | Execution rule |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------|
| `seedance_2_0` | Current S01 MCP surface auto-set `generate_audio: true`; the input key was not exposed | Set `generate_audio=true` only when `audio_generation_preferences.source=generated`; set `false` for `none` or `supplied` when the schema supports it; if unsupported, use the audio severity rule below |
| `seedance_2_0` | Mode, quality, and genre may default silently | Use manifest values. Default to `quality=standard` for final takes, `quality=fast` only for draft tests, and `genre=auto` unless a tested genre is named |
| `kling3_0` | Current S01 MCP surface auto-set `sound: "on"`; the input key was not exposed | Set `sound=on` only when generated ambient/sfx/dialogue are wanted; set `sound=off` for silent or supplied-audio shots when supported; if unsupported, use the audio severity rule below |
| `kling3_0` | S01 observed `cfg_scale: 0.5`; current session 2 surface did not expose an override | If CFG/guidance is exposed, use `0.35-0.45` for reference/identity-critical shots, `0.5` for balanced camera/landscape shots, and `0.55-0.65` for prompt-led surreal/action shots with weaker reference needs; otherwise record the manifest value as aspirational intent and rely on storyboard frames |
| `kling3_0` | Count is user-observed in MCP but not confirmed on public pages | Use `count=1` by default; use `count=2` for review-gated hero or uncertain shots only when live schema exposes count and credit/queue budget allows |
| All models | Labelled resolution may not equal actual pixel dimensions | Verify downloaded dimensions against `target_resolution` and log any mismatch |

Audio severity rule: stop when forced generated audio would conflict with dialogue,
lip-sync, narration handled as a separate process, supplied audio, music timing, or a
planned silent dramatic beat. For landscape, environment, atmosphere, or machine-vision
shots where generated ambience is acceptable or will be muted downstream, proceed only
after logging the unsupported audio override.

Stop if the live schema cannot honour a reference-adherence preference on a
continuity-critical shot and the required continuity is not already baked into the
start/end storyboard frames.

`model_overrides` in the manifest is the source of truth. If a suggested override key is
not present in the live MCP schema, mark the key unsupported in the log. Continue only if
the unsupported key is non-critical for the shot's identity, audio, and verified
resolution requirements.

## Routing Procedure

1. Read the shot intent, required references, action complexity, duration, and anchor
   images from the manifest.
2. Pick the default model from the routing table.
3. Inspect the live Higgsfield MCP model list or tool schema.
4. Translate the manifest model alias to the exact provider ID.
5. Validate duration, aspect ratio, target resolution, resolution parameter, audio
   preferences, default overrides, and media roles.
6. Record `recommended_model`, `actual_model_id`, and `routing_rationale`.
7. Stop if the chosen model cannot carry every required reference or anchor.

## Key-Frame Rule

No current Higgsfield route in this workflow accepts mid-clip key-frame anchors. Any shot
with key frames must use a shot-specifier strategy that can be submitted: split into
separate `start_end_image` sub-clips, or use `motion_control` only when the key-frame
motion has been merged into prompt text or a motion reference with a written rationale.

Legacy planning names map as follows for old manifests only:

| Legacy strategy | Shot-specifier strategy |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `single_clip` | `image_to_video` when only one source frame is supplied; `start_end_image` when both anchors are supplied |
| `split_at_keyframe` | `start_end_image` sub-clips |
| `merge_keyframe_motion` | `motion_control` only with a motion reference or explicit prompt-merge rationale |

New manifests should emit only the shot-specifier strategy identifiers.
