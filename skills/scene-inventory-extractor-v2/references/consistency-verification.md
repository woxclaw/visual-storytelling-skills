## 1. Overview

Consistency verification uses the agent's vision capabilities to compare generated shot
frames against reference images and against each other. The goal is to catch visual
inconsistencies before they are baked into video prompts, where correction costs an
entire shot regeneration.

### Verification Pass Order

Execute checks in this order (each subsequent check assumes prior checks have passed):

1. **Intra-shot: Start–end interpolatability** (per shot)
2. **Character consistency** (per shot, per character)
3. **Location consistency** (per shot)
4. **Prop consistency** (per shot, per visible prop)
5. **Intra-shot lighting coherence** (per shot: start vs key frames vs end)
6. **Cross-shot continuity** (sequential shots with continuous boundary)
7. **Thematic image consistency** (thematic images vs their source scene refs)

## 2. Severity Classification

| Severity | Code | Meaning | Action |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| **BLOCK** | `B` | Inconsistency will produce unusable video or visible continuity error | Must regenerate before proceeding to Phase 13 |
| **WARN** | `W` | Inconsistency is noticeable but may survive video generation | Log for human review; proceed with caution |
| **INFO** | `I` | Minor variation within acceptable tolerance | Log only; no action required |

### Classification Rules

| Issue | Default Severity |
|-------|-----------------|
| Subject completely static between start and end (no interpolatable change) | **BLOCK** |
| Character face substantially different from primary reference | **BLOCK** |
| Character outfit wrong (different garment, wrong colour) | **BLOCK** |
| Location architecture/layout contradicts reference | **BLOCK** |
| Prop missing from frame when shot spec requires it | **BLOCK** |
| Lighting direction reversed between start and end | **BLOCK** |
| End frame of shot N incompatible with start frame of shot N+1 (continuous boundary) | **BLOCK** |
| Character face slightly different but recognisable | **WARN** |
| Colour temperature shift between start and end (minor) | **WARN** |
| Background detail inconsistency (minor) | **WARN** |
| Depth of field inconsistency between frames | **WARN** |
| Prop detail variation (minor shape/colour shift) | **WARN** |
| Grain/texture slightly different from style anchor | **INFO** |
| Minor composition drift from specified framing | **INFO** |

## 3. Check Procedures

### 3.1 Start–End Interpolatability

**Input:** Start frame and end frame for a single shot.

**Procedure:**
1. Examine both frames side by side (or in sequence)
2. Identify what has changed between them
3. Classify the change type:
   - **Position/pose change**: Subject has moved, changed posture, or shifted orientation → PASS
   - **State change**: Something has opened/closed, appeared/disappeared, changed expression → PASS
   - **Composition change**: Camera motion has shifted the framing → PASS
   - **Only lighting/background changed**: Subject is in identical position and state → FAIL (BLOCK)
   - **No discernible change**: Frames are near-identical → FAIL (BLOCK)

**Failure description format:**
```
BLOCK: S{XX}_SH{XXX} — Start–end interpolatability failure.
Subject {description} is static between frames; only {what changed} differs.
The video model will produce unnatural motion or a frozen subject.
Regenerate end frame with explicit {position/pose/state} change.
```

### 3.2 Character Consistency

**Input:** Shot frame (start or end) + character primary reference image.

**Procedure:**
1. Compare the character in the shot frame to the primary reference
2. Check each attribute:
   - Face shape, features, skin tone
   - Hair colour, length, style
   - Body proportions and build
   - Outfit (correct garment, correct colour, correct condition)
   - Distinguishing features (scars, tattoos, accessories)
3. Score as PASS / WARN / BLOCK

**Tolerance:** AI image generation produces inherent variation. The standard is: would a
viewer recognise this as the same character? Minor variations in facial angle, slight
colour shifts due to scene lighting, and natural expression changes are acceptable.
Wholesale face changes, wrong hair colour, or incorrect clothing are not.

### 3.3 Location Consistency

**Input:** Shot frame + location reference image (matching condition).

**Procedure:**
1. Compare the environment in the shot to the location reference
2. Check:
   - Architecture and layout (walls, doors, windows in correct positions)
   - Materials and textures (concrete vs brick, wood vs metal)
   - Fixed objects and furniture (desks, monitors, fixtures)
   - Scale and proportion (room size, ceiling height)
3. Score as PASS / WARN / BLOCK

**Note:** Camera angle will differ between the reference and the shot. Focus on
structural consistency, not identical framing.

### 3.4 Prop Consistency

**Input:** Shot frame + prop reference image.

**Procedure:**
1. Identify the prop in the shot frame
2. Compare against the prop reference:
   - Shape and silhouette
   - Colour and material
   - Size relative to other objects
   - Condition/state (if a specific state variant was expected)
3. Score as PASS / WARN / BLOCK

### 3.5 Intra-Shot Lighting Coherence

**Input:** Start frame, all key frames, and end frame for a single shot.

**Procedure:**
1. Examine the sequence in order
2. Check for consistent:
   - Light direction (shadows should fall the same way unless the action explicitly involves a light-source change)
   - Colour temperature (warm/cool should match unless the action describes a change)
   - Exposure level (brightness should be consistent unless the action describes a change)
   - Specular highlights (position on reflective surfaces)
3. Score as PASS / WARN / BLOCK

**Exception:** If the shot explicitly describes a lighting change (e.g., sunrise, lights
turning on), the change is expected and should be checked for plausibility rather than
consistency.

### 3.6 Cross-Shot Continuity

**Input:** End frame of shot N + start frame of shot N+1 (only when boundary is
`continuous`).

**Procedure:**
1. These frames should be identical or nearly identical (since the start frame of N+1
   reuses the end frame of N)
2. If they are the same file, this check is automatic — PASS
3. If they are different files (error in the pipeline), flag as BLOCK

**Also check for:**
- Subject position/pose matches between end of N and start of N+1
- Wardrobe is the same
- Environment is the same
- Lighting is the same
- Any props are in the same position

### 3.7 Thematic Image Consistency

**Input:** Each thematic image (from Phase 9) + corresponding scene references.

**Procedure:**
1. Compare the thematic image against relevant character, location, and prop references
2. Verify that the thematic image matches the established visual world
3. Flags are WARN only (thematic images are editorial, not generation inputs)

## 4. Regeneration Protocol

When a BLOCK issue is found:

### Step 1: Diagnose

Identify the root cause:
- **Prompt insufficiency**: The generation prompt did not adequately describe the
  required element → Fix the prompt and regenerate
- **Reference insufficiency**: The reference image did not adequately constrain the
  generation → Consider generating a better reference first, then regenerate
- **Model limitation**: The generation model cannot achieve the required result with
  current references and prompting → Simplify the shot or accept a WARN-level
  compromise (document the decision)

### Step 2: Regenerate

- Regenerate only the failing frame, not the entire shot set
- Use the same references as the original generation
- Modify the prompt based on the diagnosis (add specificity where the failure occurred)
- If the start frame is regenerated, all subsequent frames in that shot (key frames,
  end frame) must also be regenerated (they depend on the start frame)
- If the end frame is regenerated and the next shot has `first_frame_reuse = yes`,
  update the next shot's start frame reference

### Step 3: Re-verify

After regeneration, re-run the relevant checks on the new frame. If the issue persists
after three regeneration attempts, escalate to WARN and log for human review.

### Regeneration Limit

Maximum **3 regeneration attempts** per frame. After three failures:
1. Log the issue as WARN with note "Regeneration limit reached"
2. Proceed with the best available frame
3. Include the issue in the consistency report with full details
