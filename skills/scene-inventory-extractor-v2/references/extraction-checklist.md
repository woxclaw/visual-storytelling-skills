| 2 | Identify time period and setting | Know year, location, season |
| 3 | Note narrative POV and distance | Know whose eyes we see through |
| 4 | Mark passages with strong visual imagery | Have list of key visual moments |
| 5 | Identify technical/domain vocabulary | Understand specialized terms |
| 6 | Read `references/cinematography-specification.md` | Understand filmstock/grain/grading vocabulary |
| 7 | Read `references/continuity-inventory.md` | Understand reset-focused continuity extraction rules |

## Common Errors

| Error | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Psychological descriptions | Ask "What does the camera see?" |
| Missing interface characters | Check for accounts, systems, UIs |
| Vague visual actions | Rewrite until filmable |
| Missing audio notes | Every shot needs sound |
| One-line transition descriptions | Expand to 2–4 sentences minimum |
| No existence statements in transitions | State what persists throughout |
| Camera motion mislabelled | Pan ≠ dolly; zoom ≠ dolly; verify terminology |
| Shots without reference images | Never generate frames without refs |
| Generating location images before prop references are locked | Classify required-before-Phase-12 props in Phase 6; generate all their refs before any location refs in Phase 11 |
| Named prop looks like a different object across shots | Run cross-shot prop identity check in Phase 13; if failed, regenerate offending frames using the locked prop primary ref |
| Skipping consistency verification | Always run and action Phase 13 before handoff |
| Treating continuity as downstream QA | Extract the continuity inventory before shot lists and prompts |
| Missing mundane handled objects | Log every touched, carried, consumed, opened, closed, or moved item |
| Weak reset notes | Ask whether another crew could restore the scene days later from this file alone |
| Missing scouting variants | Check every scene's lighting condition maps to a location ref |
| End frame without interpolatable change | Ensure position/pose/state/composition change |
